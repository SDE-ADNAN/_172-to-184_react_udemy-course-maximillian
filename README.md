## -- Video 173 : How to (NOT) connect to a database

- browser side apps dont directly talk to a database
- it is very bad practice to connect to a database from the browser directly
- the browser is not a secure environment to talk to a database as anyone can see the requests
- database credentials may be exposed as whole js code is visible to each user of a website
- you must have a backend to talk to the database using apis and http requests from the browser it could be any backend language like php, python, nodejs, java, etc

MUST READ:

I will use this page: https://swapi.dev/

Loading this page (and hence accessing this backend) might fail - if that is the case for you, you can use this alternative: https://swapi.py4e.com/
